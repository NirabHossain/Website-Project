        <h3>Bernoulli equation is used and abused</h3>
        <p>
            Bernoulli equation is very important to understand the fluid behavior. It can be implemented very easily for its simplicity
            (এইখানে পারলে আরো কিছু লিখবি)  <br><br>


            But the equation can only be applied in steady and inviscid fluid. But it is more often mistakenly used for unsteady and viscid fluid because of its heavy use. Even some researchers also make this mistake and publish their papers which is distracting. That's a reason why this equation is used and abused.
